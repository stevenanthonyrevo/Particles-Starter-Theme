# Particles-Starter-Theme

##How it Works


Bootstrap - Minified - Customized - Simplified 

Description: 

A Starter Theme for the Particle Framework. 


Problems we solve:   

We offer a new theme.css file that allows you to style your particles framework with speed. We also now include a custom Particles.css file that allows you to create your own particle id components. With the power of these newly added theme styles, particles can become a featuring framework. 

This is a starter theme for people in need of a barebone, minified and new way of working. With particles you can begin to cut down time and energy by including different particles into your system.
